# Examples of Keywords in a Program:

# if and else keywords: 
if 20  > 10: 
 print("x is greater than 10"); 
else: 
  print("x is less than or equal to 10")

# def keyword:
def greet(name): print("Hello, " + name + "!"); greet("John")

# for keyword:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]; 
for fruit in fruits: print(fruit)

# try and except keywords:
try: x = 5 / 0; 
except ZeroDivisionError: print("Error: cannot divide by zero!")


# These keywords are used to control the flow of a program, define functions and classes, and perform other essential tasks.
